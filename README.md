## Pointer Types
Pointer types are used to store the memory address of a variable. They are used in unsafe code, which is code that is not subject to the normal safety rules of C#.

Pointer types are used when working with legacy code, performance-critical code, or when interacting with native code.

Pointer types require an unsafe context because they can potentially lead to memory corruption or other safety issues if not used correctly.
